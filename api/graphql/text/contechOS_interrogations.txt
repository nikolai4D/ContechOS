1. Does all the layers have the same responsabilities?
    No, the object layer directly defines the type and instance layers while:
        - definition layer directly define object layer
        - type layer directly define instance layer

2. Is the property view a layer?
    It is not a layer as it is accessible by all the other layers.

3. A use case where the property of a node needs to be known by its children:
    If I set a checktype on a node, it is relevant for the children to now it and to pick a specific checktype (ex: is a number)

4. A use case where the property of a node do not need to be known by its children:
    If I pick the node property "is a number", there is no nothing needing configuration on the sub level.
    Had I picked "belongs to array", I should have set the values on the sublevel.
