--------------- Ontology (pretty sure that's how it's called) ------------------
Node = {
    id,
    title,
    parentRelationShip (->I like this one because with one property you access it, and it s up to contech os to resolve it. Not sure how hard is it to implement though)
    childrenRelationShips (-> same as above)
    sameLevelRelationships ()
    customProperties (An array. we don't use them but there would go the user defined props of the node, like a password for a user node, that would be a direct prop of the node and not related to it)
}

Relationship = {
    id,
    title,
    parentRelationShip
    childrenRelationShips
    source
    target
}

--------------- Considerations -----------------------
Having the parent, children and same level relationships properties allow to explore the graph without knowing the ids or the existence of these relationships.
Getting all the nodes linked to a origin

--------------- Examples ---------------------------

Request to get one specific node:
{
    nodes(id: $td_gghjgglugqggbl)
}

    response:
        { nodes: [
            {node object}
        ]}

Request to get all nodes:
{
    nodes
}
    response:
            { nodes: [
                {node object},
                {node object},
                {node object},
                {node object}
                ...
            ]}

Request to get parentNode id:
{
    nodes:(id: $td_jhbhjhbjh) {
        parentRel {
            target(sourceID: td_jhbhjhbjh) {
                id
            }
        }
    }
}

    Response:
    { nodes: [
        { parentRel : {
                target: {
                    id: fr_jhbhjvlvlvulvghv
                }
            }
        }
    ]}

Request to get all the profiles linked to one project:
{
    projectnode: nodes(id: $profile_id) {
        profileToProjects: sameLevelRelations(parentId: $profileRelationParentId) {
            source
        }
    }
}

    Response:
    { nodes: [
            { projectnode: {
                profileToProjectRelation: [
                    {profileObject},
                    {profileObject},
                    {profileObject}
                ]}
            }
        ]}
